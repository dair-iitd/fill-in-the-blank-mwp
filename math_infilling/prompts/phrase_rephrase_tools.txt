Given blanked question Q, we need to complete it such that its answer is A.
First, guess the blank by making use of unknown x. Rephrase the question to find x by making use of the value of A. Then solve it step b step to find the value of blank. Strictly follow the format given in the examples below.

Q: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. _____. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he have left?
A: 22

Guess: He gets x more cards
Rephrased: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. He gets x more cards. He gives 58 cards to his classmates. He has 22 cards left. Find the value of x.
Peano solution:


Let a be number of boxes [[var a]]. We have [[eq a = 4]].
Let b be number of cards in each box [[var b]]. We have [[eq b = 10]].
Let c be number of cards Ben initially has [[var c]]. We have [[eq c = a * b]].
Let x be cards he got [[var x]].
Let d be total cards with Ben [[var d]]. We have [[eq d = c + x]]
Let e be cards given to classmates [[var e]]. We have [[eq e = 58]].
Let f be cards left [[var f]]. From given Answer, we have [[eq f = 22]]. 
As cards left are also total cards - cards given to classmates, we have [[eq f = d - e]]
The answer will be the value of x [[answer x]].





Q: Natalia sold 48 clips to her friends in April, _____. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
A: 72

Guess: and sold x in May
Rephrased: Natalia sold 48 clips to her friends in April, and sold x in May. Natalia sells 72 clips altogether in April and May. Find the value of x.
Peano solution:


Let x be number of clips Natalia sold in April [[var a]]. We have [[eq a = 48]].
Let a be number of clips Natalia sold in May [[var x]].
Let b be number of clips sold altogether [[var b]]. From given Answer, we have [[eq b = 72]].
As clips sold altogether are also the sum of clips sold in April and May, we have [[eq b = x + a ]]
The answer will be the value of x [[answer x]].





Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. _____. After they are done, how many trees would be there?
A: 21

Guess: x trees were added.
Rephrased: There are 15 trees in the grove. x trees were added. After they are done, there would be 21 trees. Find the value of x.
Peano solution:


Let a be the number of trees in the grove [[var a]]. We have [[eq a = 15]]. 
Let x be the number of trees added [[var x]].
Let b be the number of trees after they are done [[var b]]. From given Answer, we have [[eq b = 21]].
We have [[eq b = a + x]].
The answer will be the value of x [[answer x]].
