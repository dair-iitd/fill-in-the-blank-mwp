Rephrase the given blanked question and answer pairs and then write a python function that finds the value of the blank. Make sure you name your method solution. A few examples are given below:

Question: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received ________ cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?
Answer: 22
Rephrased Question: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received x cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, he has 22 cards left. Find the value of x.
Program:
```python
def solution():
    num_boxes = 4
    basketball_cards_per_box = 10
    basketball_cards_in_boxes = num_boxes * basketball_cards_per_box
    # cards_received_from_mother = unknown
    cards_given_to_classmates = 58
    cards_left = 22
    
    # equation: cards_received_from_mother + basketball_cards_in_boxes = cards_given_to_classmates + cards_left
    # simplifying:
    cards_received_from_mother = cards_given_to_classmates + cards_left - basketball_cards_in_boxes

    return cards_received_from_mother
```

Question: Natalia sold clips to ________ of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Answer: 72
Rephrased Question: Natalia sold clips to x of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. Find the value of x such that she sold a total of 72 clips altogether in April and May.
Program:
```python
def solution():
    # clips_sold_in_april = unknown
    # clips_sold_in_may = 1/2 * clips_sold_in_april
    total_clips_sold = 72
    
    # equation: clips_sold_in_april + clips_sold_in_may = total_clips_sold
    # simplifying:
    # clips_sold_in_april + 1/2 * clips_sold_in_may = total_clips_sold
    # 3/2 * clips_sold_in_april = total_clips_sold
    clips_sold_in_april = 2 * total_clips_sold / 3

    return clips_sold_in_april
```
