Rephrase the given blanked question and answer pairs and then find the solution to the rephrased question. Write a python function that finds the value of x by solving step by step. Make sure you name your method finding_x. A few examples are given below.:

Question: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received ______ cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?
Answer: 22
Rephrased: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received x cards from his mother. He gives 58 cards to his classmates. He has 22 cards left.
Program:
```python
def finding_x():
    num_boxes = 4
    cards_per_box = 10
    # cards_received_from_mother = x - This line is commented because x is unknown
    # hence the variable cards_received_from_mother can't be used in R.H.S. of any calculation
    cards_given_to_classmates = 58
    cards_left = 22
    cards_in_boxes = num_boxes * cards_per_box
    total_cards_before_given_to_classmates = cards_given_to_classmates + cards_left
    
    cards_received_from_mother = total_cards_before_given_to_classmates - cards_in_boxes 
    return cards_received_from_mother
```

Question: Olivia has $23. She bought _____ bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
Answer: 8 
Rephrased: Olivia has $23. She bought x bagels for $3 each. She has $8 left. Find the value of x.
Program:
```python
def finding_x():
    money_initial = 23
    # num_of_bagels = x - This line is commented because x is unknown
    # hence the variable num_of_bagels can't be used in R.H.S. of any calculation
    bagel_cost = 3
    money_left = 8
    money_spent = money_initial - money_left
    
    num_of_bagels = money_spent / bagel_cost
    return num_of_bagels
```
