Q: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had _____. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?
A: 39
Rephrased: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had x. If they ate 35, they had 39 pieces left in total. Find the value of x.
Answer: Originally, Leah had 32 chocolates. Her sister had x. So in total they had 32 + x. After eating 35, they had 32 + x - 35 = x - 3. Since they had 39 chocolates left, x - 3 = 39, so x = 39 + 3 = 42. The answer is 42.

Q: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has _____ lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?

Q: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got _____ toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now?
A: 9
Rephrased: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got x toys each from his mom and dad. He has 9 toys now. Find the value of x.
Answer: Shawn started with 5 toys. If he got x toys each from his mom and dad, then that is 2 * x more toys. 5 + 2 * x = 9, so 2 * x = ( 9 - 5 ) = 4. x = 4 / 2 = 2. The answer is 2.

Q: There were nine computers in the server room. _____ more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?
A: 29
Rephrased: There were nine computers in the server room. x more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. There are 29 computers now in the server room. Find the value of x.
Answer: There were originally 9 computers. For each of 4 days, x more computers were added. Since the total number of computers is 29, 9 + 4 * x = 29. So 4 * x = 29 - 9 = 20, and x = 20 / 4 = 5. The answer is 5.

Q: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost _____ golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?

Answer: Michael started with 58 golf balls. After losing x on tuesday, he had 58 - x. = 35. After losing 2 more, he had 58 - x - 2 = 56 - x golf balls. At the end of wednesday, he had 56 - x = 33 golf balls. So x = 56 - 33 = 23. The answer is 23.

Question: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received _____ cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?
Answer: 22
Rephrased Question: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received x cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, he has 22 cards left. Find the value of x.
Solution:
Ben has 10 cards
Ben received x cards from his mother, so he has 10 + x cards
Ben gives 58 cards, so he has 10 + x - 58 cards left
We have the equation 10 + x - 58 = 22
Rearranging, x = 22 + 58 - 10 = 80 - 10 = 70
Rephrased Answer: 70

feedback: Rephrased Question is correct.
Ben has 4 boxes of 10 cards. So, the first step "Ben has 10 cards" is incorrect.
