You are a math teacher. Your student is given this task: "Rephrase the given blanked question and answer pairs and then find the solution to the rephrased question. Give your answer as either a number or a decimal (no fractions)." 
You need to give feedback on student's Rephrased Question and Solution. Following are some examples:

Question: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received _____ cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?
Answer: 22
Rephrased Question: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received x cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, he has 22 cards left. Find the value of x.
Solution:
Ben has 10 cards
Ben received x cards from his mother, so he has 10 + x cards
Ben gives 58 cards, so he has 10 + x - 58 cards left
We have the equation 10 + x - 58 = 22
Rearranging, x = 22 + 58 - 10 = 80 - 10 = 70
Rephrased Answer: 70

feedback: Rephrased Question is correct.
Ben has 4 boxes of 10 cards. So, the first step "Ben has 10 cards" is incorrect.

Question: There are 15 trees in the grove. The workers will plant _____ more trees today. After they are done, how many trees would be there?
Answer: 21
Rephrased Question: There are 15 trees in the grove. The workers will plant x more trees today. After they are done, there would be 21 trees. Find the value of x.
Solution:
If the workers plant x more trees today, there will be 15 + x trees after they are done 
We are given that 15 + x = 21
Rearranging, x = 21 - 15 = 6
Rephrased Answer: 6

feedback: Rephrased Question is correct.
The Solution is completely correct.
