Rephrase the given blanked question and answer pairs and then write a python function called solution() to find the value of x in the rephrased question. Return the value of x. You may assume the neccessary libraries are imported. Strictly follow the format given in the examples below, as the method will be executed with the same name.

Q: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received _____ cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?
A: 22
Rephrased: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received x cards from his mother. He gives 58 cards to his classmates. He has 22 cards left. Find the value of x.
Program:
```python
def solution():
    num_boxes = 4
    cards_per_box = 10
    total_cards_in_boxes = num_boxes * cards_per_box
    cards_from_mother = x
    cards_given_to_classmates = 58
    cards_left = 22
    
    equation = Eq(cards_from_mother + total_cards_in_boxes, cards_given_to_classmates + cards_left)
    blank = solve(equation)[0]

    return blank

Q: Natalia sold _____ clips to  her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
A: 72
Rephrased: Natalia sold x clips to her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. Natalia sells 72 clips altogether in April and May. Find the value of x.
Program:
```python
def solution():
    april_clips = x
    may_clips = april_clips / 2
    total_clips = 72
    
    equation = Eq(april_clips + may_clips, total_clips)
    blank = solve(equation)[0]

    return blank

Q: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got _____ toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now?
A: 9
Rephrased: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got x toys each from his mom and dad. He has 9 toys now. Find the value of x.
Program:
```python
def solution():
    toys_init = 5
    toys_from_mom = x
    toys_from_dad = x
    total_toys = 9
    
    equation = Eq(toys_init + toys_from_mom + toys_from_dad, total_toys)
    blank = solve(equation)[0]

Q: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost _____ golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?
A: 33
Rephrased: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost x golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. He had 33 golf balls at the end of wednesday. Find the value of x.
Program:
```python
def solution():
    init_balls = 58
    balls_lost_on_tuesday = x
    balls_lost_on_wednesday = 2
    total_balls_at_the_end = 33
    
    equation = Eq(init_balls - balls_lost_on_tuesday - balls_lost_on_wednesday , total_balls_at_the_end)
    blank = solve(equation)[0]

    return blank
