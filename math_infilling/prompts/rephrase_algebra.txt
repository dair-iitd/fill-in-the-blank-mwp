Given a math QUE, you need to fill in the blank with a number, such that the answer of the question would be equal to given ANS
To solve it, use two steps.
In first step, form a new math question by using the information in ANS and taking the value in blank as x and posing the question as mathematical problem to find x
In next step, solve that new math question step by step.

Here is an example: 
QUE: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received ________ cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?
ANS: 22

solution:
NEW MATH QUESTION: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received x cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, he has 22 cards left.
FINDING X: 
Ben has 4 * 10 = 40 basketball cards.
Ben recieved x card from his mother. so Ben has 40 + x cards
He gives 58 cards to his classmates. so Ben has 40 + x - 58 cards 
It is given that Ben has 22 cards. so 40 + x - 58 = 22
so x = 22 + 58 - 40
so x = 80 - 40
so x = 40
FINAL ANSWER: 40

Here is another example:
QUE: There are 15 trees in the grove. The workers will plant ________ more trees today. After they are done, how many trees will be there?
ANS: 21

solution:
NEW MATH QUESTION: There are 15 trees in the grove. The workers will plant x more trees today. After they are done, 21 trees will be there.
FINDING X: 
There are 15 total trees.
workers plant x more trees. so there are 15 + x total trees
It is given that there are 21 total trees
so 15 + x = 21
so x = 21 - 15
so x = 6
FINAL ANSWER: 6

Now answer this:
QUE:  {new_question}
ANS: {answer}
