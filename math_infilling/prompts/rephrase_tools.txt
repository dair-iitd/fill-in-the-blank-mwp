Question: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received ______ cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?
Answer: 22

Rephrased: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received x cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, he has 22 cards left. Find the value of x.
Peano solution:


Let a be number of boxes [[var a]]. We have [[eq a = 4]].
Let b be number of cards in each box [[var b]]. We have [[eq b = 10]].
Let c be number of cards Ben initially has [[var c]]. We have [[eq c = a * b]].
Let x be cards received from mother [[var x]].
Let d be total cards with Ben [[var d]]. We have [[eq d = c + x]]
Let e be cards given to classmates [[var e]]. We have [[eq e = 58]].
Let f be cards left [[var f]]. From given Answer, we have [[eq f = 22]]. 
As cards left are also total cards - cards given to classmates, we have [[eq f = d - e]]
The answer will be the value of x [[answer x]].





Question: Natalia sold _____ clips to her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Answer: 72

Rephrased: Natalia sold clips to x of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. Find the value of x such that she sold a total of 72 clips altogether in April and May.
Peano solution:


Let x be number of clips Natalia sold in April [[var x]]
Let a be number of clips Natalia sold in May [[var a]]. We have [[eq a = x / 2]].
Let b be number of clips sold altogether [[var b]]. From given Answer, we have [[eq b = 72]].
As clips sold altogether are also the sum of clips sold in April and May, we have [[eq b = x + a ]]
The answer will be the value of x [[answer x]].
