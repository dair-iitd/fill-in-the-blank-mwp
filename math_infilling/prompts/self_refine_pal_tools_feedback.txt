Q: Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $_____ in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kellyâ€™s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?
A: 5
Rephrased: Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost a total of x dollars, and she has 6 packets of chicken, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly's budget is $65, then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?

Program:

```python
def solution():
    bacon_cost = x
    chicken_cost = 2 * bacon_cost
    strawberry_cost = 4
    apple_cost = strawberry_cost / 2
    budget = 65
    remaining_budget = budget - (5 * bacon_cost + 6 * chicken_cost + 3 * strawberry_cost + 7 * apple_cost)
    
    equation = Eq(remaining_budget, 5)
    blank = solve(equation)[0]

    return blank
```

Correction:

The rephrased problem does not end with 'Find the value of x'. Instead, it asks us to find the money Kelly has left in her budget. This is incorrect.

Let's check the program:

    bacon_cost = x
    chicken_cost = 2 * bacon_cost

Looks good

    strawberry_cost = 4
    apple_cost = strawberry_cost / 2

Looks good

    budget = 65
    remaining_budget = budget - (5 * bacon_cost + 6 * chicken_cost + 3 * strawberry_cost + 7 * apple_cost)

The equation formed is correct, as are the number of packs of bacon, chicken, strawberry and apples

    equation = Eq(remaining_budget, 5)
    blank = solve(equation)[0]
    return blank

The equation has been equated to the correct answer, and the program returns the blank.

The program provided is completely correct!

Q: Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $_____ each. Calculate the total cost of buying each cup.
A: 145
Rephrased: Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $x each. Calculate the total cost of buying each cup.
Program:
```python
def solution():
    cups_price_per_dozen = x
    plates_price_per_dozen = x / 2
    total_cups_cost = 20 * cups_price_per_dozen
    total_plates_cost = 6 * plates_price_per_dozen
    
    equation = Eq(total_cups_cost, total_plates_cost - 1200)
    blank = solve(equation)[0]

    return blank
```

Correction:

The rephrased problem does not end with 'Find the value of x'. Instead, it asks us to find the total cost of buying each cup. This is incorrect.

Let's check the program:

    cups_price_per_dozen = x
    plates_price_per_dozen = x / 2

Wrong! each cup costs 145, as given in the answer.

    total_cups_cost = 20 * cups_price_per_dozen
    total_plates_cost = 6 * plates_price_per_dozen

Wrong! The total plate cost should be 0.5 * plates_price_per_dozes, as we're buying half a dozen plates

    equation = Eq(total_cups_cost, total_plates_cost - 1200)
    blank = solve(equation)[0]
    return blank

The equation is correct, and we return the value of the blank.

The program provided is incorrect.

    cup_price = 145
    num_cups = 20 * 12

Q: Carly had 80 cards, _____ of the cards had the letter A on them, 1/2 of the remaining had the letter B, 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them, and the others had the letter D. How many of the cards had the letter D on them?
A: 9
Rephrased: Carly had 80 cards, x of the cards had the letter A on them, 1/2 of the remaining had the letter B, 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them, and 9 had the letter D. Determine the value of x.
Program:
```python
def solution():
    total_cards = 80
    cards_with_A = x
    cards_with_B = (total_cards - cards_with_A) / 2
    cards_with_C = (total_cards - cards_with_A - cards_with_B) * 5 / 8
    cards_with_D = 9
    
    equation = Eq(cards_with_A + cards_with_B + cards_with_C + cards_with_D, total_cards)
    blank = solve(equation)[0]

    return blank
```

Correction:

The rephrased problem looks correct: it incorporates the answer 9 and asks us to find the value of x.

Let's check the program:

    total_cards = 80
    cards_with_A = x
    cards_with_B = (total_cards - cards_with_A) / 2

Looks good

    cards_with_C = (total_cards - cards_with_A - cards_with_B) * 5 / 8

Looks good

    cards_with_D = 9

We correctly incorporate the answer

    equation = Eq(cards_with_A + cards_with_B + cards_with_C + cards_with_D, total_cards)
    blank = solve(equation)[0]
    return blank

The equation is correct, and we return the blank

The program provided is completely correct!

Q: Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips holds _____ chips. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?
A: 4
Rephrased: Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips holds x chips. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. If he has two bags of glass chips, he can make his mosaic 4 inches long. Find the value of x.

Program:
```python
def solution():
    chips_per_square_inch = 12
    mosaic_height = 3
    bags_of_chips = 2
    mosaic_length = x

Correction:

The rephrased problem is correct. It uses the provided answer 4 and also asks us to find the value of x.

Let's check the program:

    chips_per_square_inch = 12
    mosaic_height = 3
    bags_of_chips = 2

These values are correct

    mosaic_length = x

Wrong! The mosaic length should be 4 inches

    equation = Eq(chips_per_square_inch * mosaic_length * mosaic_height, bags_of_chips * x)
    blank = solve(equation)[0]

This equation is incorrect

The program provided is incorrect.
