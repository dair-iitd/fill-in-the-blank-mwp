Given blanked question and answer pairs, write a python function that finds the value of the blank by solving step by step. Make sure you name your method solution. A few examples are given below.:

Question: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received ______ cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?
Answer: 22
Program:
def solution():
    num_boxes = 4
    basketball_cards_per_box = 10
    basketball_cards_in_boxes = num_boxes * basketball_cards_per_box
    cards_given_to_classmates = 58
    cards_left = 22

    """
    Comments on solving step-by-step
    equation: cards_received_from_mother + basketball_cards_in_boxes = cards_given_to_classmates + cards_left
    simplifying:
    """

    cards_received_from_mother = cards_given_to_classmates + cards_left - basketball_cards_in_boxes

    return cards_received_from_mother


Question: Natalia sold ______ clips to her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Answer: 72
Program:
def solution():
    total_clips_sold = 72
    
    """
    Comments on solving step-by-step
    equation: clips_sold_in_april + clips_sold_in_may = total_clips_sold
    given that clips_sold_in_may = 1/2 * clips_sold_in_april
    clips_sold_in_april + 1/2 * clips_sold_in_may = total_clips_sold
    3/2 * clips_sold_in_april = total_clips_sold
    simplifying:
    """

    clips_sold_in_april = 2 * total_clips_sold / 3

    return clips_sold_in_april
