Given a math QUE, you need to fill in the blank with a number, such that the answer of the question would be equal to given ANS
Here is an example:

QUE: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received ________ cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?
ANS: 22
Let's think step by step
Ben has 4 x 10 = 40 basketball cards.
Suppose Ben recieved x card from his mother.
Then Ben has 40 + x cards.
After giving away 58 cards, he has 40 + x - 58 = x - 18 cards left.
The answer is x - 18 = 22.
So x = 40.
Ben therefore received 58 - 40 + 22 = 40 cards.
The blank is "40".

Here is another example:

QUE: There are 15 trees in the grove. The workers will plant ________ more trees today. After they are done, how many trees would be there?
ANS: 21
Let's think step by step
There are 15 trees originally.
Then there were 21 trees after the workers planted trees.
The workers must have planted 21 - 15 = 6 more trees.
The blank is "6".
