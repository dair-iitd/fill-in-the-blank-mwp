You are given a math question with a blank value and an answer. Solve it step b step to find the value of blank. Strictly follow the format given in the examples below.

Question: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received ______ cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?
Answer: 22

Peano solution:


Let a be number of boxes [[var a]]. We have [[eq a = 4]].
Let b be number of cards in each box [[var b]]. We have [[eq b = 10]].
Let c be number of cards Ben initially has [[var c]]. We have [[eq c = a * b]].
Let d be cards received from mother [[var d]]. This is blank.
Let e be total cards with Ben [[var e]]. We have [[eq e = c + d]]
Let f be cards given to classmates [[var f]]. We have [[eq f = 58]].
Let g be cards left [[var g]]. From given Answer, we have [[eq g = 22]]. 
As cards left are also total cards - cards given to classmates, we have [[eq g = e - f]]
As d is blank, the answer will be the value of d [[answer d]].





Question: Natalia sold _____ clips to her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Answer: 72

Peano solution:


Let a be number of clips Natalia sold in April [[var a]]. This is blank.
Let b be number of clips Natalia sold in May [[var b]]. We have [[eq b = a / 2]].
Let c be number of clips sold altogether [[var c]]. From given Answer, we have [[eq c = 72]].
As clips sold altogether are also the sum of clips sold in April and May, we have [[eq c = a + b ]]
As a is blank, the answer will be the value of a [[answer a]].





Question: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant _____ trees in the grove today. After they are done, how many trees would be there?
Answer: 21

Peano solution:


Let a be the number of trees in the grove [[var a]]. We have [[eq a = 15]]. 
Let b be the number of trees grove workers will plant [[var b]]. This is blank.
Let c be the number of trees after they are done [[var c]]. From given Answer, we have [[eq c = 21]].
We have [[eq c = a + b]].
As b is blank, the answer will be the value of b [[answer b]].
