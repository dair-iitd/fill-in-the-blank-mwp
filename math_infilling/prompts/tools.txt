Question: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. Ben received ______ cards from his mother. If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?
Answer: 22

Peano solution:


Let a be number of boxes [[var a]]. We have [[eq a = 4]].
Let b be number of cards in each box [[var b]]. We have [[eq b = 10]].
Let c be number of cards Ben initially has [[var c]]. We have [[eq c = a * b]].
Let d be cards received from mother [[var d]].
Let e be cards given to classmates [[var e]]. We have [[eq e = 58]].
Let f be cards left [[var f]]. From given Answer, we have [[eq f = 22]]. 
We have [[eq d = f + e - c]]
The answer is the value of d [[answer d]].




Question: Natalia sold _____ clips to her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Answer: 72

Peano solution:


Let a be number of clips Natalia sold in April [[var a]].
So number of clips Natalia sold in May are half of a.
Let b be number of clips sold altogether [[var b]]. From given Answer, we have [[eq b = 72]].
We have [[eq a = b / (1 + 1/2)]]
The answer is the value of a [[answer a]].





Question: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant _____ trees in the grove today. After they are done, how many trees would be there?
